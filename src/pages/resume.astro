    <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Lynn.</p>
    <p>
      I'm a <Highlight>full-stack software engineer</Highlight> with more than {
        new Date().getFullYear() - 2017
      } years of professional experience building and maintaining digital products
      and services, with a focus on the Web.
    </p>
    <p>
      I specialize in building APIs, websites, and web applications using modern
      tools. Tech I have extensive experience in -- and enjoy working with --
      includes <Highlight>PHP</Highlight>, <Highlight>TypeScript</Highlight>,
      <Highlight>React</Highlight>, <Highlight>Next.js</Highlight>, and <Highlight
        >Tailwind CSS</Highlight
      >, but I'm also always open to learning new things.
    </p>
    <p>
      I most enjoy working with ethical, human-friendly, forward-thinking
      companies that employ diverse, autonomous teams, and don't shy away from
      investing in good engineering. If that's you, let's work together!
    </p>
