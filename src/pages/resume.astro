    <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Lynn.</p>
    <p>
      I'm a <Highlight>software engineer</Highlight> with more than
      {yearsOfExperience} years of professional experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of my work so far has focused on the web and related technologies,
      but I'm always interested in learning new things.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've worked for and with all kinds of organizations, but I work best with
      people-first teams that care deeply about their work and understand the
      value of good engineering.
    </p>
    <p>If that's you, please get in touch!</p>
