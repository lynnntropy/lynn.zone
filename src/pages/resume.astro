    <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Lynn.</p>
    <p>
      I'm a <Highlight>software engineer</Highlight> with more than {
        new Date().getFullYear() - 2017
      } years of professional experience building and maintaining digital products,
      with a focus on the web.
    </p>
    <p>
      I specialize in building websites, web applications, and APIs using modern
      tools. I have many years of experience working with
      <Highlight>TypeScript</Highlight>, <Highlight>React</Highlight>, and
      <Highlight>PHP</Highlight>, but I'm also always open to learning new
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      I most enjoy working with human-first, forward-thinking organizations that
      don't shy away from investing in good engineering. If that's you, please
      get in touch!
    </p>
